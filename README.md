# CMDataset
To facilitate replication of the study : "A New Approach to Locate Software Vulnerabilities Using Code Metrics", we make publicly available in this GitHub repository the following materials: 
•	The proposed dataset (In ‘arff’ format to support Weka API),
•	The source code (Java) of the tool used to carry out the experiments.
•	The source code (C++) of another tool that can be used by other researchers who may want to apply changes on the proposed dataset before using it
