# CMDataset
To facilitate replication of the study : "A New Approach to Locate Software Vulnerabilities Using Code Metrics", we make publicly available in this GitHub repository the following materials: 
•	The proposed dataset (In ‘arff’ format to support Weka API),
•	The source code (Java) of the tool used to carry out the experiments.
•	The source code (C++) of another tool that can be used by other researchers who may want to apply changes on the proposed dataset before using it

Please cite the following paper if using the dataset or the source code in your research work :
